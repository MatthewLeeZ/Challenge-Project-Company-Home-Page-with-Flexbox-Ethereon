## Overview 📝

This project is a company homepage built using **Flexbox** for layout. Inspired by the Codecademy challenge project, it includes:

- A title and a logo or splash image.
- A mission statement or brief description of the company.
- A set of images and titles representing the company’s products.
- A section introducing the company’s employees or team members.

## Description 🖋️

The goal of this challenge was to master Flexbox for creating flexible, responsive layouts. The design adapts gracefully as screen sizes change, transitioning from a grid-like layout to a column layout on smaller screens. In addition to meeting the basic requirements, I added personal creative touches:

- **Responsive Design:** Implemented media queries to adapt the site for tablets (768px, 569px) and mobile devices (320px, 569px).
- **Creative Customization:** Developed a unique narrative for the company, designed custom images (mainly using [DeepAI](https://deepai.org/)), and chose an original color scheme and typography to make the site stand out.

## Features ✨

- **Flexbox Layout:** A flexible layout for the navbar, products, and employee sections.
- **Responsive Design:** Optimized with media queries for various screen sizes.
- **Custom Styling:** Personalized colors, fonts (via Google Fonts), and images.
- **User Experience:** An intuitive layout that highlights the company’s key content.

## Technologies Used 💻

- **HTML5** – Markup structure
- **CSS3** – Styling with Flexbox and media queries
- **Google Fonts** – Custom typography

## Credits 🎨

- **Images:** Primarily generated using [DeepAI](https://deepai.org/).

## Feedback 💬

I really enjoyed working on this project—my first website built entirely on my own. I dove deep into Flexbox and responsive design, and I’m proud of both the final result and the learning process. I would appreciate any feedback on:

- My use of Flexbox and potential layout optimizations.
- The implementation of media queries for responsive design.

Your suggestions and insights will be invaluable for my future improvements!
